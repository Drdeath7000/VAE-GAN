# VAE-GAN
Generated images and implement two different generative models:
Variational autoencoder
generative adversarial network. 

Generated new data using a special type of autoencoder model which allows us to sample from its latent space. We'll implement and train a VAE and use it to generate new images.

 Implemented and trained a generative adversarial network and apply it to the task of image generation.
